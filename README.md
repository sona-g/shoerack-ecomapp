# SHOERACK- an ecommerce platform selling men's footwear 
A REACT project (frontend only) using ASOS API.

## Time Frame
1 week

## Description
The project was my first react project. Being from a retail space I felt extremly passionate about creating an ecommerce platform from scratch.
The App is built to browse products, see product details, add to wishlist and add to cart. The product quantity can be changed in cart as well as from navbar.

## Run the app
The app can run on https://ecom-app-sona-g.vercel.app/ 

## Summary
The project gave me a good understanding in React state management and integrating multiple features. In future I plan to add filters n search features.
